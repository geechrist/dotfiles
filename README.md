## Installation

First, make sure you have all those things installed:

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `curl`: to download some stuff
- `tar`: to extract downloaded stuff
- `zsh`: to actually run the dotfiles
- `sudo`: some configs may need that

Then, run these steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./script/bootstrap
$ zsh # or just close and open your terminal again.
```

> All changed files will be backed up with a `.backup` suffix.
